# Books
Who doesn't like books? I do! So when I came across a dataset with more than 11000 books, I had to explore it in depth! I'm the type of reader who can read almost anything! From romance to horror, except some genders are more challenging to get through than others. But my overall favorites are fantasy! I'm sure I'm not the only one out there who loves to enter a fantastic imaginary world to escape the real one, and if you add just a little bit of romance... I'm all in! 

Every year, I create a plan for how many books I want to read, and it's always exciting to follow my friends and YouTubers to see how they're doing. However, finding new books to read can be difficult at times, as it's easy to get stuck in a cycle of reading the same types of books. I often wonder if this is due to the saying "birds of a feather flock together" or if there are other factors that contribute to certain, in my opinion, poorly written books receiving high ratings.

## ðŸŽ¯Objective:
This project explores a fascinating dataset of books to uncover insights into publishing trends, author prominence, and book characteristics such as length (number of pages) and popularity (ratings and reviews). With a special focus on outliers and temporal dynamics, we aim to provide a unique perspective on the publishing industry's evolution over time.
